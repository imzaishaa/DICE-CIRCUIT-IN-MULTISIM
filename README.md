# DICE-CIRCUIT-IN-MULTISIM
This project simulates an electronic dice circuit using NI Multisim. The circuit mimics the function of a standard 6-sided dice, generating a random number (1 to 6) when a push button is pressed. The number is displayed using a 7-segment display or a combination of LEDs to represent dice faces.
